# Bachelor-Thesis

This formalization project begins with the narrative of _Chapter 3: Quotient Groups and Homomorphisms_ from _**Abstract Algebra**_ by Dummit & Foote.  
It is built on top of *mathlib*, using its existing formalization of group theory, rather than redefining concepts from scratch.

## Goal
 - Formalizing selected exercises from D&F in Lean 4
 - Submiting PRs of possibly interesting and useful lemmas to *mathlib*

## Theorems
#### Phase I : Until the Intro talk
- AbelianSimpleG (from exercise 3.4.1): without the premises that _G_ is *finite*.
- HallSubgroup (from exercise 3.3.10): concerning the definitions of _Hall Subgroup_ and orders
- CauchyAbelian : the abelian group version of Cauchy's theorem
#### Phase II : After the Intro talk (appr. from December)
- to be continued...
