/-! In mathlib there already exists a general version of `Cauchy's theorem`,
    which is proved by using properties of orbit decomposition.
    Here we show a special case that if a group is also abelian,
    then the proof of Cauchy's theorem could be made by induction.-/

/-! *Proposition 21* from Chapter 3 in _Dummit&Forte_ :
    If G is a finite abelian group and p is a prime dividing |G|,
    then G contains an element of order p. -/
